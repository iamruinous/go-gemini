# go-gemini

`go-gemini` implements the [Gemini protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space) in
Go.

It aims to provide an API similar to that of `net/http` to make it easy to
develop Gemini clients and servers.

## Examples

See `examples/client` and `examples/server` for an example client and server.

To run the examples:

	go run -tags=example ./examples/server
